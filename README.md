# Mutual-Debt-Simplification
In a group of people with debt between themselves, this program finds the absolutely necessary transactions to _wipe away the debt_.
**If you have graphviz installed it will also generate a nice visualization of the resulting graph**

### To run:
0. (Optional) Install graphviz: `pip install graphviz`
1. edit the `debt_list.json` file as needed
2. run `python mutual_debt_simplification.py`
