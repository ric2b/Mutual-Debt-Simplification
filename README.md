# Mutual-Debt-Simplification
In a group of people with debt between themselves, this program finds the absolutely necessary transactions to wipe away the debt.
**If you have graphviz installed it will also generate a nice visualization of the resulting graph**

### To run:
0. (Optional) Install graphviz: `pip install graphviz`
1. edit the debt_list as needed
2. run `python mutual_debt_simplification.py`
